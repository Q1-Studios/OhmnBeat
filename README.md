# Ohm'n'Beat

Enter the Oscilloscope and resist the waves of incoming current!

Ohm'n'Beat (canonical pronunciation btw) is a flashy Q1 rhythm game with a brand-new original song (and two fan-favourite reprises from our previous jam-games).

You can try our game on [Itch.io](https://q1studios.itch.io/ohmnbeat) or watch the trailer on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/KU0LBrwBNSU)!
